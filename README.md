# Fish-Express Integration

## Overview
This repository provides guidelines and examples for integrating **Fish shell scripting** with an **Express.js** server. The integration follows **SOLID design principles** to ensure the solution is **extensible**, **scalable**, and **resilient**. It is useful for managing system-level operations (e.g., backups, logging, server monitoring) alongside an Express.js-based web server.

## Repository Contents
- **Fish Scripts**: Example scripts for handling server-side tasks like file operations, system monitoring, and process management.
- **Express.js Server**: Sample Express.js code that demonstrates how to invoke Fish shell scripts securely and efficiently.
- **Best Practices**: Design patterns, principles, and strategies for ensuring a clean architecture and robust system integration.

## Key Features
- **Separation of Concerns**: Express.js handles the application logic, while Fish shell scripts perform non-critical system tasks.
- **Microservice-Friendly**: Fish shell tasks can be treated as microservices, with Express.js acting as an orchestrator.
- **Asynchronous Task Handling**: Using job queues to manage long-running tasks and avoid blocking the main Express.js event loop.
- **Event-Driven Design**: Fish scripts are triggered via event-driven architectures or message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ).
- **Resilience**: Fault-tolerant design with retry mechanisms and centralized logging for both Fish scripts and Express.js.
